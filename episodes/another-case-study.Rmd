:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- Can I apply what I learnt about R for a different case study? 
- How do I read data from an online dataset in R? 
- How can I look up specific parts of the dataset? 
- How can I visualise specific parts of the dataset?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explore a larger dataset using the same methods introduced in the previous episodes
- Recognise that you can use the same code to explore different datasets, irrelevant of their size

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::: keypoints

- An advantage of using R to work with data is that the same code can be run for different data sets of different sizes (subject to the data sets being in similar formats)
