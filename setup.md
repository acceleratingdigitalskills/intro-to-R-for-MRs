First, download R (there are 3 versions to choose from, depending on your device’s OS – Mac, Windows, or Linux) from here and install: https://cran.r-project.org 

After R is installed, download RStudio Desktop here: https://posit.co/downloads/ 

Press on the ‘Download RStudio’ button. This will direct you to installation set up with 2 steps.
Step 1 is installing R which you will have already done, so skip that and go to Step 2.
Download RStudio by either pressing on the button below ‘2: Install RStudio’ or from the options available when scrolling down the web page (choose one depending on your OS) and install.

Once installed, try opening RStudio Desktop to check that it works.

The RStudio environment is what we will be working in during this lesson. 

## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.

1.	Make a new folder in your Desktop called r-intro-music-research.
2.	Download the r-intro-data.zip and move the file to this folder.
3.	If it’s not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it. You should end up with a new folder called data.
