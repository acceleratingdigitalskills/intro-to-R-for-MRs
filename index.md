This course offers a gentle introduction to the programming language R for music researchers. 

Some of the important steps involved in transforming downloaded data into workable data will be covered. The course touches upon running some basic analyses and creating visualisations of data. The course aims to give learners a basic understanding of some best practices when writing code in R to encourage reproducibility in research, and also recognise certain pros and cons of using a programming language (like R) as against a graphical tool (like Excel) to work with data.

No prior programming experience is required, but before joining this course, learners should:
- be able to download and install R and RStudio
