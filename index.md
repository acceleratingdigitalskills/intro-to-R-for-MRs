This is an introduction to R and RStudio designed for music researchers with no programming experience. The lesson aims to showcase how an individual might find R useful for their music research. Some initial information about the R syntax and navigating the RStudio interface are given, followed by information about how to import CSV files, clean your data, look at subsets of your data, carry out some initial statistical calculations, visualising different elements of your data, and finally, present some best practices when writing code in R.

Two example case studies are used in this lesson, featuring two types of web data sets - by no means does this lesson present an exhaustive list of the uses of R. The case studies presented are two of several potential use cases of how an individual may use R for their research and to work with data.

The main aim is to give a taste of what R can do for music researchers, and hopefully encourage researchers to consider R as one of multiple useful tools in their tool kit when it comes to working with data for their music research. 

:::::::::::::: prereq
