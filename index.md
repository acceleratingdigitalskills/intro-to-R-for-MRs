This is an introduction to R and RStudio designed for music researchers with no programming experience. The lesson aims to showcase how an individual might find R useful for their music research. Some initial information about the R syntax and navigating the RStudio interface are given, followed by information about how to import CSV files, clean your data, look at subsets of your data, carry out some initial statistical calculations, visualising different elements of your data, and finally, present some best practices when writing code in R. Two example case studies are used in this lesson, featuring two types of web data sets - by no means does this lesson present an exhaustive list of the uses of R. The case studies presented are two of several potential use cases of how an individual may use R for their research and to work with data. The main aim is to give a taste of what R can do for music researchers, and hopefully encourage researchers to consider R as one of multiple useful tools in their tool kit when it comes to working with data for their music research. 

:::::::::::::: prereq

-	This lesson requires R and RStudio to be installed on the learner’s device. 
-	The two dummy data set files need to be downloaded in preparation for this lesson.

### R and RStudio setup instructions

First, download R (there are 3 versions to choose from, depending on your device’s OS – Mac, Windows, or Linux) from here and install: https://cran.r-project.org 

After R is installed, download RStudio Desktop here: https://posit.co/downloads/ 

Press on the ‘Download RStudio’ button. This will direct you to installation set up with 2 steps. Step 1 is installing R which you will have already done, so skip that and go to Step 2. Download RStudio by either pressing on the button below ‘2: Install RStudio’ or from the options available when scrolling down the web page (choose one depending on your OS) and install.

Once installed, try opening RStudio Desktop to check that it works. The RStudio environment is what we will be working in during this lesson. 

Downloading the data sets to follow this lesson:
1.	Make a new folder in your Desktop called r-intro-music-research.
2.	Download r-intro-data.zip and move the file to this folder.
3.	If it’s not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it. You should end up with a new folder called data.
